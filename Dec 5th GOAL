Kathryn Moormann - Find data for each state from USA.com (such as sources of energy for each state, average time to drive to work, etc) and write a code to extract the data from the website using the html and the website’s tabulated data to create a pandas dataframe 



Friday December 5th - Create a final and overarching data set with all our information

Goal by the end of Friday - assign state features to each state individually by making new columns and applying to specific counties
